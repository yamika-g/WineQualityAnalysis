#Wine Quality Analysis

Wine is intriguing because of the complexity and layers of its flavour. This project tries to go deeper and understand the attributes and the basic factors that determine the quality of white wine and make it taste a certain way.

The Wine Quality Dataset has been taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository for white wine analyses.

This project aims to:

1. Determine factors that significantly affect the quality of white wine,
2. Interpret the effects of such factors on the quality of white wine,
3. Use the determined factors to predict the quality of white wines,
